## Problem statement
[View PDF](https://github.com/alorodri/hashcode-practice-2021/blob/main/src/practice_round_2021_v3.pdf)

## Team
Our Hashcode team "Nevergoes" is composed by daniuss, [jaimuepe](https://github.com/jaimuepe) and me. We've participated in the 2019 and 2020 editions.

## Algorithm
The code is a bit messy, but i'll try to clean it up a little bit when i have more time. I also want to move the writeOutput function to the fileutils.h.

Initially the algorithm tried to prioritize the deliveries for the 4-people teams, then the 3-people teams, and last the 2-people teams.
Then I rewrote the algorithm so it could work with different criteria that can be assigned on the compute method.
