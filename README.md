## Problem statement
[View PDF](https://github.com/alorodri/hashcode-practice-2021/blob/main/src/practice_round_2021_v3.pdf)

## Team
We have a team called nevergoes, that participated in 2019 and 2020 competitions.
My teammates are [@jaimuepe](https://github.com/jaimuepe) and @daniuuss

## Algorithm
Code is a bit messy, when I have more time I'll try to clean it a bit, also moving the writeOutput fcn to the fileutils.h

At first, I've worked on a algorithm that prioritizes pizzas for 4-people teams. Then, when teams of 4 are fullfilled, works sending pizzas for 3-teams and 2-teams respectively. Later was rewritten to work with different priorities that you can assign on the compute method call.
